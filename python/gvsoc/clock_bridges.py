"""
Registry of clock-domain-crossing bridge IP kinds for io_v2 bindings.

A "kind" is a string tag that the systree binding pass uses to pick which
bridge component to splice in when a v2 master and its bound slave resolve
to different clock sources. Each kind maps to a factory ``(parent, name,
**opts) -> Component`` that instantiates the corresponding wrapper.

System designers can:

  - Leave the default ``'sync_only'`` (matches v1 auto-crossing: bring the
    remote engine up to date before forwarding, no modeled latency; a
    response is resynchronized on the next edge of the master clock).
  - Use ``'shared_clock'`` between two domains driven by the same clock
    (shared edges, no synchronizer on the chip): a response arriving on an
    edge goes through at once, as inside one domain.
  - Override per binding via ``itf_bind(..., clock_bridge='async_fifo')`` or
    ``clock_bridge=('async_fifo', {'depth': 4})``.
  - Set a policy on a parent component via ``set_clock_bridge_policy`` for
    all crossings between a specific (src_clock, dst_clock) pair.
  - Register additional kinds with :func:`register`.
